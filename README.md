# Hi there, I’m Eli Borovoy 👋

I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science at NYU Tandon in NYC. My aim is to build useful tools and apps that people can use to solve problems or improve/add to existing solutions. My focus is on software engineering and machine learning, and I am interested in making solutions for real-world applications.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On
- **Machine Learning & AI Projects:** Applying ML techniques to real-world problems and consistently improving my skills in data science and model development.
- **Web & Tool Development:** I build interactive and user-friendly applications, ranging from audience response systems, to summer camp schedule-building apps, to Voice AI app modules. 
- **Collaborative Open-Source Projects:** I’m always open to working with others and sharing knowledge along the way. Check out my repositories for some of my ongoing projects!

## 📌 Current Focus
- **Project Development:** I’m refining a range of web applications and data analysis and visualization tools.
- **Skills Growth:** Constantly learning new frameworks and technologies, recently including Hugging Face, Keras, and Spark.

## 🔧 Skills
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, C++, C, SQL, Java, JavaScript, Matlab
- **Libraries & Tools:** PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Spark, D3, Django, Flask, Matplotlib, PostgreSQL, Firebase
- **Interests:** Machine Learning, Data Science, Databases
